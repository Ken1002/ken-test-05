<p><b>Ken Andreasen</b> earned his diploma of technology from BCIT in 1986.  Presently I am working for Pacific Rim Engineered Products (PREP) since June 2004. PREP is a company, which designs, manufactures and supplies control and automation equipment for the Oil and Gas industry. I have designed, written software, commissioned oil field based equipment. One project was an all-electric service vehicle that is based on ABB variable frequency drives; Allan Bradley PLC’s and Allen Bradley touch screens. I designed most of the electronics and wrote all of the software for this project. All of the vehicle’s equipment was electric including the propulsion system. It was self-propelled and made it’s own power from an onboard generator, and could be driven on highway to oil well sites. The rig was used to disassemble/reassemble oil and gas wells, and has a 250,000-pound lifting capacity. I also wrote software for several fully automated land based drilling rigs. As well as developed software for a sophisticated 8 speed dual clutch transition with several patents pending.</P>

<p>I also have an additional 18 years experience with the design, repair, and installation of electronic and mechanical marine control systems with Prime Mover Controls. My formal training is in the field of electronics, I like working with my hands, and I am very mechanically inclined. I follow direction very well and can work without supervision. I enjoy working in industrial environments and adapt well to any type of work environment. I am always eager to learn and often read technical manuals, and attend training in my spare time. I am in excellent physical condition and work out routinely.</p>
